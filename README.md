# Sportsvaganza
- App diagnoses sports news (fetched from NYtimes API) of a particular country, extracts the type of sport from the news. 
- This refined data is integrated with Google Tables (to fetch the names of sports players of the country), Twitter API (to pull latest tweets of the players), BBC sports event calendar (to extract upcoming events pertaining to a sport and the country) and Wikipedia API (to deduce the snippet of the event) to provide powerful meaning to user.
- Designed a semantic web model based on datasets and used Protégé to develop corresponding ontology. Data instances were queried using SPARQL and Apache Jena Fuseki framework to create SPARQL end-point.
- GUI is implemented using JSP and HTML
